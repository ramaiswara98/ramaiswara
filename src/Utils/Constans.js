    ABOUTME : `I'am a fullstack developer that love to work on web app or mobile app, I love code because it's like a magic how a line of code can be something beautifull on user screen. And also how a line of code can make someone life become more easier
    
    I have over 2 and the half years profesional experience as fullstack developer, mainly working using MERN stack. Beside that, sometime I am working on personal project to test out the new tech stack that I just learn, like react native, tailwind css, and more.

    I have eager to learn something new, I consider my self adaptable and well comunnicate. I also a fast learner, the reason is when I start my professional work as full stack developer at Code For Asia, I don't know anything about MERN Stack, but after around one year, I am even successfully help the junior developer intern in the company to pick up MERN stack.
    
    Of course I am not perfect, but if you dare to give me an opportunity, then I will deliver what you whish, I can't promise you the output as perfect as you want, but I can promise you, that it will be the best that I can present
